# Where Am I Going (WAIG)

## Overview
Travel app giving indecisive people a place to generate a country to visit.

## Approach Taken
24 Hour hackathon based on the theme 'travel'. App created consists of a landing page showing users the title of the app where the image and title are clickable. Once clicked leads to a loading page consisting of an animated globe with a setTimeOut leading to a randomly generated country and information on the country and trending twitter hashtags in that generated destination.
